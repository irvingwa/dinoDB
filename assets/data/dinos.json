In art, the Acrocanthosaurus is often portrayed as very similar to the Allosaurus, as it is in truth an member of the Allosauroid family. Special attention is called to its tall spinal formation, sometimes depicted as a ridge of external spikes or even a dorsal fin."

Alexeyisaurus lived during the Late Triassic and resided in Europe. Not much is known about this recent discovery from the Arctic far north of Russia. It was a plesiosaur, or sea dinosaur, most likely from the mid-Jurassic. Like the whales which came long after them, plesiosaurs were descended from four-legged land dwellers that took to an oceanic life."

Discovered in 1984, it has a unique claim to fame. Amargasaurus had a double row of long spines sticking up from its shoulders and back. Were they for defense, or display? The experts are still arguing."

The Ankylosaurus is a squat, quadruped dinosaur remarkable for its armor plating and club-like tail. An hebivore, it was active during the late Cretaceous period and is the most well-known example of its family, Ankylosauridae. As with the other more popular dinosaurs, the depiction of the Ankylosaurus in art has changed considerably over the years as more and more new information has come to light. In early illustrations, the gait of the Ankylosaurus was more squat, and it carried its tail low to the ground; it is now known that it walked with its hind legs held straighter, and its tail high in the air. Newer illustrations will sometimes incorporate these changes in understanding. Artistic depictions of the Ankylosaurus will often exaggerate the elements of its armored plates, usually adding spikes and other features that more accurately reflect other members of the Ankylosauridae family."

Apatosaurus was a sauropod that lived during the late Jurassic period. Like most sauropods, it was an herbivore that moved about on four legs, with a long craning neck and protruding tail for balance. It is believed that Apatosaurus held its head upright for grazing, more like Brachiosaurus, and not cast forward like Diplodocus. For a long time, people used the term Brontosaurus to refer to the Apatosaurus, due to a long feud between the paleontologist-adventurers Cope and Marsh. Eventually it was decided that Marsh's discovery took precedence, and that Apatosaurus was indeed the correct name for the genus. However, in 2015 it was resolved that Brontosaurus was a legitimate genus of its own!"

Its fossils have been found in places such as Free State of Bavaria (Germany), Valencian Community (Spain) and Baden-W�rttemberg (Germany). Archaeopteryx was a small dinosaur, roughly the size of a pigeon. It had feathers, and a visually-adapted brain that was far in advance of most contemporary creatures in the late Jurassic. But it didn't have the kind of claws for secure perching on a branch. And ever since the first discovery in 1860 there has been controversy. Initially, Archaeopteryx was widely accepted as the 'missing link' between dinosaurs and birds, and most commentators agreed to call it 'the first bird'. With the discovery of a further 11 specimens, all from the limestone strata at Solnhofen in Germany, the experts are more cautious. The creature had distinctive reptilian features, and just a few that resembled the anatomy of modern birds, such as a wishbone. It had been incapable of raising its wings above the horizontal, so could only make half a flap. Nowadays, the experts think Archaeopteryx could have made only short upward flights, followed by a glide. For some, it is not the first avian species, but a highly important precursor of true birds, as one of the earliest steps on the evolutionary process which led to them."

Active during the late Cretaceous, this enormous creature may have been over 100 feet long and weighed more than 80 tons. Unlike Bruhathkayosaurus, there is an existing skeletal reconstruction for Argentinosaurus that provides a basis for its claim as the largest of the thunder lizards. It is thought that once hatched from an egg, an Argentinosaurus would not stop growing for the entirely of its life. Argentinosaurus is depicted in art as similar to many sauropods, with a long neck and tail protruding laterally from a stocky body on four stout legs. It is sometimes depicted with spines running from its head all the way to the tip of its tail."

Baryonyx was a distinctive-looking theropod of the early Cretaceous, found primarily in what is now northern Europe. Its name translates from the latin as 'heavy claw', and it indeed had a large, heavy claw at the end of its forelimbs. Its appearance is also marked by a long, balancing tail and a relatively small skull for a theropod, which tapers into a very narrow jaw. In artwork, Baryonyx is often depicted making use of its outsized claws to catch and devour fish. It can be recognized by its crocodilian head."

The brachiosaurus is a tall sauropod with a comparatively short tail and upright posture. Its front legs are longer than its hind legs, and its head has a distinctive nasal opening that is prominently shown in many of the illustrations depicting it. Unlike many other sauropods, which orient themselves lengthwise along the ground, the Brachiosaurus' posture is directed upward. Many researchers believe this enabled it to reach the higher limbs of treetops and vegetation, in much the same manner as a giraffe. Brachiosaur remains have been found in North America, Europe and Africa, although some researchers claim that these actually represent separate genera."

Bruhathkayosaurus may be the largest of all dinosaurs. Then again, it might not! Only one fossil specimen was ever discovered in southern India, and it was since lost or destroyed by a tsunami. All that remains are some fairly abstract drawings, which lend considerable doubt to any claims about the size of the beast. When it was originally discovered, it was thought by its excavators to be a therapod and carnosaur, similar to Allorsaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex. However, later researchers made convincing arguments that the bones belong to a sauropod. Bruhathkayosaurus has been estimated to weigh over 100 tons, but without any remaining fossils to study, there's not much certainty around this particular find. Bruhathkayosaurus is often depicted in a similar manner to diplodocus, a barrel-chested sauropod with four column-like legs and a long neck and tail protruding laterally from the body. However, due to the controversy around the Bruhathkayosaurus' discovery and the lack of remaining evidence to base artistic renditions upon, all illustrations can be considered mere guesses."

Camarasaurus was the most common sauropod to be found in North America. It existed in the late Jurassic period. Its name means 'chambered lizard,'' after the large spaces along its spinal column that resemble distinct chambers. It is now suspected that these spaces were actually filled with air and connected to the respiratory system. This would have reduced the overall weight of the creature to a level manageable for its trunk-like legs to carry. This feature is suspected to be common amongst large sauropods. The largest Camarasauruses found was 75 feet long and may have weighed up to 50 tons. In artwork it is depicted with a short, protruding tail, an upright neck, and a small, boxy head. The innermost toe on each foot bears a hooked claw, which is one of this creature's most characteristic features."

      "description": "Ceratops was a herbivore. It lived in the Cretaceous period and inhabited North America. Its fossils have been found in places such as New Mexico and Montana. Horned and frilled, this was a large family of Cretaceous dinosaurs. The most familiar is Triceratops, the three-horned species commonly found as a plastic model in toy shops. But there are many more species in this formidable herbivore family, who chose to face trouble head-on with an array of defensive and offensive weapons. The great-granddaddy of the line has yet to be discovered, but we know that he must have lived in central Asia about 100 million years ago. There is evidence that early frilled and horned dinosaurs were preyed upon by large theropods such as T. Rex. One dramatic duel to the death between a ceratopsian and a velociraptor resulted in a unique double-fossil record. As the aeons went by, the ceratops family spread out into a great family tree of tough survivors. All of them had bony defensive frills to protect the neck and throat, and long forward-facing horns in various patterns. Ceratopsians ranged in size up to specimens which topped out at 16 tons and 30 feet. There is evidence that they grazed and travelled in herds. All of these fossils come from sites in North America, which fits the theory that the ceratopsians walked over from Asia during Cretaceous times, on a land bridge used millions of years later by Mankind. A paleontologist can still build a flourishing career on the ceratopsian family alone, in all its fascinating variety."

She had small, but still-useful forelimbs, and the first wishbone known to paleontology. The experts suspect that she was a sharp-eyed, fleet-footed predator of small game with excellent depth perception. There are many good samples from Ghost Ranch in New Mexico - and one distant relative from Zimbabwe in central Africa: Coelophysis rhodesiensis."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Telangana (India), Arizona and Yunnan (China). Dilophosaurus was a carnivorous theropod during the early Jurassic period. It is highly recognizable due to the two flat, spreading crests atop its head. The predator was about 20 feet (6 meters) in length from head to tail, but stood only about as tall as an adult human. The purpose of the Dilophosaurus' crests is a matter of some debate, though most researchers agree that they were likely aesthetic in function or used for heat regulation, rather than weapons. In art, the Dilophosaurus is always distinguished by its crests. It is also often depicted with feathers or feather-like constructs, since as with most theropods it is now thought to have had them. Notably, artists inspired by the Jurassic Park films may include a frill around the neck, like that of a frilled lizard. This is known to have been artistic license on the part of Michael Crichton, but has worked its way into the popular conception nonetheless."

With its disproportionately large head and tucan-like mouth lined with barbed teeth, the Dimorphodon is actually thought to have spent most of its time on the ground, using its folded wings as forelegs. As one might imagine from its ungainly body plan, it may have only been capable of short flights. In art, the Dimorphodon is very often depicted in mid flight, since earlier conceptions of the creature's behavior tended toward similarities with other pterosaurs."

      "description": "Diplodocus was a herbivore. It lived in the Jurassic period and inhabited North America. Its fossils have been found in places such as Utah, Colorado and Texas. For a long time, Diplodocus' claim to fame was being the longest land-dwelling dinosaur. It is named for for the structure ('double-beamed') of the bones on the underside of its colossal tail. While there have since been other discoveries of even longer sauropods, many researchers assert that these may, in fact, be direct relatives of Diplodocus. As long as a city bus, moving on sturdy, trunk-like legs, and with a beaming neck and tail, the Diplodocus was an herbivore that browsed the foliage of the Jurassic. It is sometimes depicted with a row of spines running from its head to its tail. The spines were introduced to illustrators after a discovery of new fossils at a single site, but the fossils in question have since been recategorized as a form of barosaurus. Early artists' renditions of diplodocus' posture depict a straddling gait, with the legs put out to the side and belly dragging along the ground, something like an iguana. It was through later researchers' assessments of tracks and skeletal mechanics that it was decided Diplodocus probably had a standing gait more similar to that of a horse. Later illustrations tend to depict this kind of posture instead."

It resembles the latter closely, but has more elaborate ornamentation on its crest around the bony bowl that both genera share. Some researchers think that Dracorex and another genus called Stygimoloch may actually represent growth stages of the Pachcephalosaurus rather than distinct genera of their own. The name Dracorex means 'dragon king' and the only known species of Dracorex is named 'Hogwartsia' in honor of the Hogwart's school from the Harry Potter series of novels. Art depicting the Dracorex usually emphasizes the spiked protrusions from the skull that make up the crest."

The first fossils emerged from Hell Creek in South Dakota and Cretaceous sediments in Wyoming during the 19th century. After sporting various scientific names, the species has been known as Edmontosaurus since 1917, and a discovery in the Edmonton geological formation in Canada. It grazed the plains of Saskatchewan along with Triceratops, in the final years of the Cretaceous, just before the mass extinction that gave the mammals their shot at world domination."

Elasmosaurus was one of the largest plesiosaurs, living during the late Cretaceous period. It was enormous in scale, reaching up to 46 feet in length, albeit much of its length was accounted for by its incredibly long and serpentine neck. When it was originally discovered by Edward Cope, he mistakenly believed that the creature's neck was in fact an extremely long tail. Researchers believe that the purpose of the creature's long neck was to allow it to reposition quickly and catch prey that would otherwise be able to out-maneuver the larger mass of the Elasmosaurus' body."

A carnivorous theropod similar to-but larger than- the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the remains of Giganotosaurus were discovered in what is now Argentina. Its name is very similar to that of Gigantosaurus, but the two are very different; the former being a bipedal meat eater and the latter a quadrupedal herbivore. Giganotosaurus remains have been found close to fossils of Titanosaur and other large hebivorous dinosaurs, so many researchers have theorized that Giganotosaurus preyed primarily on these creatures. It is depicted in art as similar to other theropods, with an enormous reptilian head bristling with teeth, small dangling clawed arms, powerful legs and a balancing tail. Some artists depict a row of spines running down the back to the tip of the tail."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Lower Normandy (France), Romania and Castile-La Mancha (Spain). This English dinosaur was named in 1824, from a handful of teeth which seemed to have come from a giant iguana. Semi-complete specimens were discovered later, and a controversy ensued in which creationist figures intervened in a dispute with the original discoverer, geologist Gideon Mantell. But less controversial samples were to come. In the year 1878, Belgian coal miners dug into a trove of at least 38 Iguanodon fossils, 1000 feet underground. Investigation of all these fossils led to much deeper information about the Cretaceous species, which lumbered across the Earth some 125 million years ago. The Iguanodon was a bird-footed plant eater, with a mass of at least three tons, measuring 33 feet from its nose to the end of a long horizontal tail. Its estimated top speed was about 15 mph. It was one of these four-footed dinosaurs which could get up on their hind legs when they needed to. This made the species a 'missing link' of sorts. It represented an evolutionary stage between Jurassic bird-footed bipedal species, and the gigantic duck-billed Brachiosaur-type dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous, firmly planted on four enormous feet."

It is thought to have been more than 30 feet long; 10 feet longer than a great white shark! Kronosaurus fossils have been found with their stomachs full, showing us that they preyed on turtles and smaller plesiosaurs at the very least. Artistic depictions frequently make use of this knowledge and show the Kronosaurus pursuing its prey."

Liopleurodon was a sea-dwelling reptile of the middle Jurassic period. It was a form of short-necked plesiosaur which existed in the regions that now comprise Europe. Liopleurodon is frequently depicted with protruding teeth at the front of its mouth, from which it derives its name meaning 'smooth-sided teeth'. Some early estimates as to the length of Liopleurodon were based only on the size of its skull, which resulted in a drastic exaggeration of its proportions. Reports of an 85 foot long aquatic leviathan captured the public imagination, and the creature's size was reported as fact in multiple television features. As a result, artistic depictions sometimes emphasize the huge size of Liopleurodon, with varying interpretations as to the length of its neck. In truth, the genus was likely close to only 20 feet in length, and had a very short neck for a plesiosaur."

Its fossils have been found in places such as South Carolina, South Dakota and Alabama. The Mosasaurus was an enormous aquatic lizard of the late Cretaceous, dwelling in what would become the North Atlantic Ocean. It is named for the Meuse river where the first fossil specimen was discovered. The largest species of the Mosasaur species could grow to over 50 feet long, with a streamlined skull bristling with teeth, a barrel like trunk for its midsection, and a long, powerful tail. It was an aquatic reptile, not a fish, as evidenced by its two sets of fins. Early paleontologists initially suspected that the Mosasaur was an ancient crocodile or monitor, but eventually it became clear that it was a different species altogether, unrelated to any modern animal. Mosasaurus lived near the surface of the water, since it breathed air, much as whales do. They were carnivores, feeding on whatever edible animals were unfortunate enough to cross their path - likely fish, plesiosaurs, and even other Mosasaurs!"

This dinosaur was a tough guy back in the day, about 100 million years ago. He was like a walking tank, covered in armour. And Nodosaurus could get on with munching his soft diet, while small predators blunted their sharp teeth on his well-protected body, which was covered in a layer of bony plates and nodules. He was a member of the Ankylosaur family, and could grow up to 20 feet in length, with a mass of 1.8 tons and a hefty club for a tail. Discovered in 1889 in Wyoming, this Stegosaur relative stomped around in the mid-Jurassic as one of the founding fathers of a tough armoured dynasty. After him came a radiation of chunky anklylosaurs which split into two families. We don't have to try very hard to come up with a reconstruction of Nodosaurus, for a recent specimen unearthed by Canadian miners looks like an accurate plaster cast of the animal. Every nodule, every wrinkle in the skin is preserved to perfection. The fossil is the most accurate ever found, with a stunning impression of the finest anatomical features. This is the jewel of fossils!"

Its fossils have been found in places such as Nebraska, South Dakota and Alberta (Canada). Pachycephalosaurus is a bipedal ornithischian, most recognizable for the bowl-like crown that tops its ultra-thick skull. They were around 15 feet long from head to tail, and stood about 4 feet high at the shoulder. They were active in North America during the late Cretaceous Period, in what is now the upper midwest United States. It was once thought that Pachycephalosaurus would ram each other head on with their skull plates as they competed for mates and territory. Further research showed that this would have been highly destructive and that their physiology didn't adequately protect them from this kind of behavior. Although it is still thought that they used their thick skulls as a weapon, it is now believed that they most likely attacked to the side, rather than ramming targets head-on."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Thuringia (Germany), Greenland and Lorraine (France). The word 'Dinosauria' was first printed in 1842, at the beginning of the paleolontogical revolution which is still going strong. And in those early days, Plateosaurus was one of the species which fired the imagination of scientists and schoolkids alike. The first specimen appeared in Swabia, Germany, in 1834. But since then, more than 100 fossils have been uncovered in Swabia, which makes Plateosaurus one of the best-known dinosaurs ever. Many of these two-ton creatures may have met their deaths in swamps or quicksand. Plateosaurus was a plant eater, some 33 feet long, dating back to the Triassic, standing on its hind legs. But the much shorter forelimbs were still functional, with three fingers capable of a crushing grip. Plateosaurus fragments have been recovered from Greenland, and sea bed drill cores off the coast of Norway."

It used four fins and a short broad tail for mobility, and had a serpentine neck almost as long as the rest of its body, with a small head at the end. They were usually about 11 feet in length, full grown. Plesiosaurus is just one genus of many that form the family Plesiosauriae. In artistic depictions, many artists do not draw a distinction between these types of Plesiosaur. Additional, much of the art depicting the Plesiosaurus is heavily influenced by cryptozoid mythology surrounding the Loch Ness Monster and other similar creatures."

Pteranodon lived during the Late Cretaceous and resided in North America. With its kite-like body and wing structure, and a streamlined beak and crest, the Pteranodon is an airborne monster built for speed. However, the Pteranodon is not actually a dinosaur, but a pterosaur. This academic distinction doesn't seem to have hurt its reputation among dinosaur lovers, and the Pteranodon is very often depicted alongside dinosaurs. The Pteranodon dwelt along the Western Interior Seaway, an ocean channel that would eventually become dry land in western North America. It had a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and its flight pattern probably resembled that of a large sea-bird. Its diet included fish, which may have resulted in the distinct formation of it's spear-like skull and beak, adapted for diving from a great height to catch a meal."

The Rugops is a smaller theropod carnivore that dwelt in what is now the African continent during the late Cretaceous period. The only recovered fossil of a Rugops is a single skull, from which most of the other details known have been extrapolated. It was estimated to have been around 20 feet (6 meters) long, and to have stood just above the head of an adult male human. Its arms are likely to have been vestigial and served little purpose, like many other theropods."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Tataouine (Tunisia), Daraa-Tafilalet ???? ???????? (Morocco) and Tahoua (Niger). The Spinosaurus was a truly enormous theropod of the Cretacious period, so called because of the line of spindly growths extending from its spine. It was among the largest of the theropods, if not the largest, with estimates topping out at up to 59 feet. This dwarfs even its most infamous cousin, the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, by a whopping 19 feet. Spinosaurus was long thought to be a bipedal dinosaur, but recent developments have lent credence to the theory that-at least part of the time-it moved about on all fours. The function of its dorsal spines is debatable, with some researchers positing that it is for aesthetic display, and others for heat regulation, while still others see the evidence of fish in the Spinosaurus' diet as supporting the use of a dorsal fin for swimming. In art, the Spinosaurus may be depicted as bipedal or quadrupedal depending on the date of the work. The dorsal spines most often form a fin on the creature's back, and its head is long and narrow, resembling that of a crocodile."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Utah, Xinjiang (China) and Texas. Among the most famous of all dinosaurs, the Stegosaurus is recognized chiefly for the two rows of armored plates that ran down the length of its spine from its head to the tip of its tail. It had a narrow, tapering head held close to the ground, and its forelegs were considerably shorter than its hindlegs. As with the other more popular dinosaurs, the depiction of the Stegosaurus in art has changed considerably over the years as more and more new information has come to light. In early illustrations, the gait of the Stegosaurus was more squat, and it carried its tail low to the ground; it is now known that it walked with its hind legs held straighter, and its tail high in the air. Newer illustrations will sometimes incorporate these changes in understanding. The plates that line the Stegosaurus' back have inspired much debate as to their function. While they were initially thought to serve as armored protection for the creature's back, some alternative theories have recently been proposed, ranging from an aesthetic display to heat regulation."

Its fossils have been found in places such as Languedoc-Roussillon (France), Argentina and Madhya Pradesh (India). The Titanosaurus was a genus of sauropod that reached sizes of up to 40 feet long. For a long time, the existence of Titanosaurus as a discrete genus served only as a home for anomalous sauropod fossils that were suspected of being a distinct genus. Over time, however, many of the features that distinguish Titanosaurus have been found to be quite common in other sauropod remains. Titanosaurus is often depicted as a burly sauropod, like Apatasaurus or Diplodocus, but with a thicker, broader neck and shorter tail. However, these reconstructions are considered dubious at best, since it is not known for certain if a specific sauropod genus of Titanosaurus exists. Titanosaurus is also the name of a fictional Kaiju monster in Godzilla films. This creature is not related to the pre-historic Titanosaurus. It is depicted as bipedal, with a distinctive crest atop its head. If an illustration shows Titanosaurus walking about on two legs, it is probably not a dinosaur but a rampaging Kaiju!"
